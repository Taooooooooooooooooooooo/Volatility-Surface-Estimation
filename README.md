# Volatility-Surface-Estimation
Implied volatilities by the option chain data SPY and further analyzed by the parametric model SVI.

In the report, we calculated implied volatilities by the option chain data SPY. We interpolated the data to construct a smooth surface by RBF method and visualized implied volatility across strike and expiry. We further analyzed the data by the parametric model SVI. The SVI parameters were fitted by nonlinear least squares optimization under specific constraints.
